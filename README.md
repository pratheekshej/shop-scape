# React + Vite
This template provides a setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# ShopeScape
This React project is an E-commerce app given a name ShopSpace with two main functional routes included inside.

1) Product Listing Page
2) Cart Details Page

The app was developed with latest version of nodejs (v20.9.0) and npm (v10.1.0) installed.

Follow the below steps to run and build the code: -

1) After installing nodejs, from within the project directory, hit the command: [npm install] or [npm i] to have the dependencies installed.
2) After the dependencies are completed, hit [npm run dev] to run the code (Since the project gets React working in Vite, the scripts in package.json is generated with vite commands)
3) To build the project, hit [npm run build] which will create a dist folder with the build inside and this can be serverd using live servers.

the project will by default be serverd at the address: http://localhost:5173
